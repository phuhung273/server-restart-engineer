## Use Case
**OS configuration, install additional software,...**

For normal Lambda, you can only install language-specific libraries, like Python's pip, Node's npm or Java's maven.

In this blog, we'll implement a [Crawler Lambda that must install Chrome driver at OS level with Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers)
