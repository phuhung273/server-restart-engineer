title: TLS testing on CI pipeline
---

> CI unit/intergration test should mimic the same behaviour on production

## Situation
- Your production database is TLS enabled
- Unit test must ensure the same TLS behaviour, eg: unit test on a Postgres docker image

<strong>Possible solutions:</strong>
- Use a dev database: costly (must always be up running) and have to erase entirely after pipeline finish
- Spawn a new database with docker

## Objective
- Create an script that can access both a Postgres docker image (dev) and a RDS database (prod)
- Creating a CA chain that can work with both prod and dev
